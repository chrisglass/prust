Prust
======

Prust is a simple example of an in-memory pastebin service.

It doesn't come with a lot of bells and whistles but does work as a very basic
pastebin service written in Rust.

It is mostly meant as a learning project, and to poke at the various web
frameworks available.


Running
--------

Simply running `cargo run` on the top-level directory should work on a
reasonable Rust version (this was developped on stable on Ubuntu 20.10)

The server is started on port 3000, to which you can point a web browser.
